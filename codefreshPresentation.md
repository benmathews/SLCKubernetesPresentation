# Vivint Deployments - Manual VMs  - Three Years Ago

* Large installation of VMs
* Deployment was a 3-4 hour, completely manual process
* We tolerated problems
* We tolerated pain (speaker notes)

---

# Vivint Deployments - Manual Kubernetes - Jan 2018

* First Kubernetes in production
* Early 2019 shut down the last of the old VM infrastructure

---

# Vivint Deployments - Manual Kubernetes - Jan 2018

## Great

* Deployment faster - under an hour
* More reliable
* Scheduling
* Restart failed processes
* Resource caps
* All the great K8S stuff

---

# Vivint Deployments - Manual Kubernetes - Jan 2018

## But

* But still manual
* Numerous mistakes
* Typing wrong image tag
  * Forgetting to add new parameters
  * Etc.

---

# Manual Kubernetes Complex

* Hand editing YAML configs
* Syncronizing similar deployments across beta and production
* Wanted multiple dev and QA environments
  * Impossible w/ handcrafted YAML

---

# Helm

* Config as code
* Updates/Rollbacks
* Templating

# Helm public charts

---

# Helm demo

* helm init
* helm deploy
* helm rollback
* helm history

---

# Vivint Deployments - Helm - 2018/2019

## Great 

* Faster - half hour
* Deployments more reliable

---

# Vivint Deployments - Late 2019

## But

* Ops still types helm commands to do deployments
* Still mistakes
  * Once mistakenly applied the beta config to the production deploy

Long list of helm deploy commands
helm diff -C3 upgrade router-nebo vivint/router --version '0.2.6-release20190820-aab8485' -f k8sconfig/configmap/mrmeseeks/router.yaml --set global.image.tag='6.release-2019-08-20-aab8485'

---

# Helmfile

Engaged Codefresh to resolve these problems

Dustin Van Buskirk suggested Helmfile

* Close the config as code loop

---

# Helmfile demo

TBD

# Vivint Deployments - Helmfile - Late 2019

## Great 

* Faster - 5 minutes
* Deployments more reliable

---

# Vivint Deployments - Helmfile - Late 2019

## But

* Manual workflow 
  * Editing wiki pages
  * Slack messages
  * Miscomunication and mistakes resulted in deployment mistakes and outages
* Still too slow
